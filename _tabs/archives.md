## Summary

XLab's reworked client IW4x is a modification of the fan-favourite Call of Duty game: Modern Warfare 2. Their mission is aimed towards fixing the flaws present in the original version of the game, which they open-source to involve the community as possible. So far, they've managed to build up a strong positive reputation among many players across multiple iterations of the CoD-franchise. I've personally tried some of their modified clients and I can tell you that they have done an incredible job with breathing new life into older CoD games.
